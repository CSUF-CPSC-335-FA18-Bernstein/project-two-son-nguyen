Submission:
 1. File "project2.cc" with all required functions completed
 2. File "experiment.cc" with modification for running both merge and quick sort with 2 options:
	(a) n = 5000 to 90000, step = 5000.
	(b) n = fixed value = 90000, run 50 times. This is to calculate the average, standard deviation, best case, worst case, and analyze the relation among the values
 3. file "Statistic_Analysis.pdf" with plotted data, chart, some statistics of average, min, max, and standard deviation, and analysis of the efficiency of the two algorithm.
